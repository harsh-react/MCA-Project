TOPIC OF THE PROJECT- This should be explicitly mentioned at the beginning of the Synopsis. This being
the overall impression on the future work, the topic should be able to corroborate the work.
OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE: This should give a clear picture of the project. Objective should be clearly
specified. What the project ends up to and in what way this is going to help the end user has to be
mentioned.
PROCESS DISCRIPTION: The process of the whole software system proposed, to be developed, should be
mentioned in brief. This may be supported by DFDs / Flowcharts to explain the flow of the information.
RESOURCES AND LIMITATIONS: The requirement of the resources for designing and developing the
proposed system must be given. The resources might be in form of the hardware/software or the data
from the industry. The limitation of the proposed system in respect of a larger and comprehensive system
must be given.
CONCLUSION: The write-up must end with the concluding remarks-briefly describing innovation in the
approach for implementing the Project, main achievements and also any other important feature that
makes the system stand out from the rest.
